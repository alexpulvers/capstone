# This website was designed by Alex Pulvers 9/20

## The purpose of this website is to create a space where brewers can link up and work out the details of working in a shared rentable space to reduce the cost of equipment and space needed in order to brew your own craft beer. The idea is similar to a "hackerspace" for local brewers.

## This project is intended for:

There is a growing number of independent first time beer and wine makers, especially in the Pacific North West. With the rapid exchange of information on the internet, more people are looking to try their hand at brewing. The problem with brewing (as myself and some family members ran into) is the space and tools required to make quality beer and wine. The space needed for proper sanitation procedures, as well as storage for massive cylinders, carboys, and all other forms of heavy equipment, is often not available to those who live within the boundaries of the city. That is why this project exists.
In the early 2010's there were a series of community organized movements to create NPOs called "Makerspaces" or "Hackerspaces". These companies would rally the community of makers and hackers to sign up for this club, pay a very affordable fee, and then have a centralized space to use expensive tools, and get together to collaborate on ideas. Some of these spaces even offered monthly classes. I believe that the same community energy can be focused to share a wealth of knowledge and experience in one space to allow the community to explore the world of brewcraft.

**This project will, at it's minimum:**

- Allow a user to sign up for an account/login
- List details for pricing, fees, available equipment, and terms of use
- Users can reserve/unreserve equipment
- Include an interactive calendar where members can select time blocks to use the equipment
- An admin functionality where an admin can see all user reservations, can block/ban users that abuse the site

**This project will use**

- Google Calendar API - allow users to select times to use the equipment

**If there is time to spare, I would like this project to include**

- Allow users to post in a forum/have DM abilities
- An ability to push notifications to users' emails when they have an upcoming reservation
- Add a cancelation recovery method, so if a user is unable to use the time they've requested, another user may step in for that time slot.
- Add a challenges or competition element, where users can submit their beer and all members can taste and vote on their favorite. The winner would recieve a prize.
- Add a "Recipe of the month" section that shares a recipe for a unique beer that users can try out if they like.

**Additional tools, frameworks libraries, or APIs that I will may need for these features include**

- There is existing framework to build an online forum so one would not have to rely solely on social media to communicate. One such tool is Formik, a react API for designing custom forums. (https://formik.org/)
- It would be nice to implement some type of "badge" system that awards users that extend help to newer users, or tracks the amount of time one has spent brewing to let newer users know that someone is a community leader they could ask for help.
